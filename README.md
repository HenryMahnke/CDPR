interesting updates:
proposed 2 year project, 1st year design, 2nd year testing
physical space at cornell may not be ready until may of 2025
like idea of 2 year project
would like timeline to be accelerated
would like 4-6 months earlier, so 1.5 year
have built in money for pay - undergrad research time
budgeted some help from consortium directly to support interns as well as graduate interns - good number of interns being minnesota students 
like going to cornell for a summer
more detailed conversations with cornell ppl going forward
- would likely be included in that.
